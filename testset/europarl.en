Moreover , regarding these small businesses , we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in , the yellow card , instead of an immediate red card , which will be a large fine and will threaten the company 's very existence .
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight . I hope that we can thrash this out .
The Commission will also support the presidency 's efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering , an eminently cross-pillar issue .
The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term , because they are very important subjects in themselves . Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC .
This is why , I urge you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange . These amendments will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting Member States the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints , since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the Members States , and some of them work perfectly well , will be able to continue to operate .
And since this is St. Valentine 's day , as a former Mayor of a regional city , I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European regions which need that love .
We should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions in the European Union , for which the Commission is responsible .
Mr President , I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach .
. Let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the EU and ACP countries .
However , it is imperative that the EU speaks and acts as one , and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve .
Up until the Amsterdam Treaty , there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures , which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens .
The European Union , in all of its aspects , must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes .
In a debate within the Socialist Party on the Irish process , someone said : " In the end , the key to the Irish solution was that everyone involved had the following thought : does it really matter whether we are Irish or British ?
I am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one , for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy .
Benchmarking and best practice , which the Commission recommends , calls for a large measure of Europe-wide transparency in those fields where industrial secrecy does not apply .
I particularly wanted to congratulate President Prodi on emphasising the issue of governance in the overall planning process .
We wish to initiate this debate , and to fuel and feed it on the basis of these proposals , as I undertook , in order to facilitate to some extent , the difficult negotiations within the Intergovernmental Conference .
Article 23 of the Universal Islamic Declaration of Human Rights says that no one shall be forced to leave the country of his residence or be arbitrarily deported therefrom .
Amendments to the legislation on co-incinerators or the specific treatment of hazardous waste risk creating cost distortions or even causing unjustified transportation of waste elsewhere .
It is a challenge which has still to be met , but I understand what was meant by that comment .
With enlargement , the European Union has clearly announced to all candidate countries that respect for democracy , the law , human rights and minorities is a basic accession criterion .
The list of activities that are eligible for aid is not exhaustive , which is indicated in the word " particularly " .
Our basic concern relates to the possible effectiveness of the actions planned for countries such as Afghanistan , Somalia or Iraq , where political instability is combined with constant violations of the most basic human rights .
The last part of section 4 of our opinion , following the words " Community action programmes should cooperate " , is to be deleted .
In principle , there are three criteria governing the acceptance of a new additive : technological need , usefulness for the consumer and harmlessness .
That is our challenge .
I cannot see that " EU origin " is currently sufficient in the way of labelling and we are opposed to that proposal .
I listened to Mr Segni 's speech .
However , Article 6 cannot be invoked for the purpose of any type of interference in the administration of the internal affairs of Member States , particularly at judicial level .
Unanimity cannot be limited to constitutional decisions .
They must be differentiated according to whether a scheme is internal or external to the enterprise . They must allow managers to determine the best investment strategy .
In Baden-Württemberg alone the accumulation of storm wood runs to about 25 million solid cubic metres . This equates to three times the average annual felling and this has already led to 30% lower timber prices .
On Mrs Hautala 's point , I would simply say that none of the appointments that have been announced today was the subject of a panel and there is a very straightforward legal reason for that . Mr David O ' Sullivan , for instance , will take up his post by rotation as provided for under the Staff Regulations and equally as provided for under the Staff Regulations , Mr Ricardo Levi is a temporary official and moves with his post to his new position .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Conference of Presidents which is to meet on Thursday will look into the situation in any case and will see what grounds there are for holding the votes on Friday .
What is more serious than this is the fact that the Commission 's reports on VAT collection have been scandalously disregarded by the other institutions and have not been followed up to any degree by the Member States .
Mr President , this is refreshing - the fact that the European Union is acknowledging that there are problems but that we have solutions .
When Mrs Ahern spoke , she spoke of the NII giving a damning indictment of the plant .
They should have a democratic government and a pluriform parliament which keeps the government in check .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel 's excellent report , which we have before us , on the European Commission communication , " Towards a European research area " , has aroused genuine interest in the House judging by the fact that almost 150 amendments have been tabled .
What research basically needs is an increase in its funding , which is unacceptably low for the European Union as a whole ( 1.8% of GDP compared with 2.8% in the USA and 2.9% in Japan ) , while countries such as Greece , which is at the bottom of the EU league , spend a miserable 0.5% .
That is why I stated to Parliament the Commission 's intention of presenting to the Council and Parliament in the autumn of this year a communication on immigration policy , precisely to give us the broader picture within which these partial and sectoral issues can be fully and properly integrated .
To those opponents , I would like to reveal that in the Netherlands , Mr Maaten belongs to the Liberal Party which adopts the most non-interventionist approach to industry 's interests and which has turned the free market principle into its cardinal ideology .
Reducing inequality in terms of the use of modern technology is most probably this project 's most important aim .
It is also plain that the Commission 's lack of human resources for both conflict prevention and crisis management greatly impinges upon our capacity to make more rapid progress in this field , though that is something we are attempting at present to address .
This is best done by looking at the three main instruments provided by the association agreement linking the European Union to Tunisia .
I hope that we shall be giving the Commission a certain amount of room for manoeuvre in the use of these funds because the speed at which programmes are implemented is often much more important than accounts in black and white down to the last penny .
Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo , I hereby confirm the commitment I made to you yesterday on behalf of the Commission on the status of European political parties . The Commission will shoulder its responsibilities .
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed .
Strasbourg , where he was mayor for twenty four years , represented for him the symbol of this opening up , the visible sign of French-German reconciliation and a sign of hope and confidence in the future of Europe .
One cannot underestimate the importance of the " Amsterdam leftovers " as we prepare ourselves for this enlargement .
The third and last element consists of combating illegal immigration , and particularly criminal networks .
It is vital , if we are to have a truly sustainable transport policy that this process is reversed .
The Council should take this into account in future in negotiations of this kind , if it wants to secure our agreement under a simplified procedure !
If this ban is adopted - and we can support it , above all if there is a supposed risk to children - we will also support Amendments Nos 11 , 13 and 24 because the Commission should amend this directive in the event that the Scientific Committee approves the use of methods of measurements for practical purposes .
This is a general problem in Greece , the implementation of Community waste legislation .
That is because control mechanisms have not kept pace with the increase in activities .
B5-0620 / 2000 by Mr Corrie and Mr Johan Van Hecke , on behalf of the Europe People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on the situation in Fiji and the Solomon Islands ;
We must not delude ourselves as to the nature of employment policy and the social policy of the EU in general or the interests which it represents , which is why , despite sharing the EU 's positive position on the protection of working women , we believe this is nothing more than yet another report of ideas and good intentions .
This intolerable attitude is an insult to the millions of immigrant workers who contribute to the wealth of Europe .
As regards Africa , the presidency will be organising an initial follow-up meeting to the Cairo Summit and working to develop relations with sub-regional organisations in accordance with the provisions of the Cotonou Convention .
For the rest , however , it is a complicated matter to attempt harmonisation with countries which are not yet members of the European Union .
This issue is so important that we must make an effort to reach a consensus .
Heaton-Harris report ( A5-0199 / 2000 )
What is really devastating is that they have actually prevented the people who should have got the money from rural depopulation for ensuring that people who did lose income actually got the money and I would like to see the Commission ensure that Coillte get no more money because they were not entitled to it in the first place and that they have to pay it back .
If we were applying the rules of economics , we would have to act differently .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as Mr Medina Ortega said , we too must reiterate the unfortunate position of the conflict in Colombia , and highlight that in the Peace Community in La Unión , in the region of Urabá , there have been three murders since 1997 .
An alternative proposition is that we start half an hour earlier at 8.30 and then have the voting time at 11 o 'clock .
In general terms , it can be said that the Committee on Development and Cooperation , and myself , are in agreement on the broad approach of the document and on the measures it proposes .
They are not tolerant , they have spoken for more than three-quarters of an hour , they cannot stand just one minute by me , that is their democracy .
Madam President , after listening to my Danish colleague , you can appreciate the fatuous level at which the debate was carried on in Denmark , a debate which led to a 'no ' vote .
That is the suspicion which persists !
This will be reflected in the coming challenge of the OSCE which Romania adopts in January 2001 and perhaps in 2002 when Romania 's probable membership of NATO will be reviewed .
The amendment needs editorial changes to make clear that these actions are within the responsibilities of the Member States .
Again I quote : " some enlightened employers are realising the potential of employing people from right across the board , from all walks of life .
As I assume that action against child sex trafficking is one of the Commission 's priorities , will a new application procedure be initiated to carry on funding the ECPAT project ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it was certainly a sensible initiative on the part of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities to compile a report on the Commission 's annual reports concerning equal opportunities for men and women in the European Union , covering the period from 1997 to 1999 .
I think this is extremely important , as is the fact that the Socialists have changed their initial position , because the sinking of the Express Samina has not only shocked Greece , it has shocked the whole of Europe .
The Commission 's communication affirms that democracy is a fundamental value of the EU Member States , the EEA States and the candidate countries , as well as a key part of external relations and development cooperation in the Union .
Reinforced cooperation must therefore respect the principles set out in the Treaties and be conducted within the single institutional framework of the Union .
Firstly , with regard to the low levels of budgetary implementation , in particular of expenditure classified as " non-compulsory " , a special requirement is introduced for requests to the Commission for explanations .
Ladies and gentlemen , the report we issued on 14 March 2000 outlines a strategy which will , I believe , enable the European Union to make a more effective contribution to sustainable development in these outermost regions and thereby to implement Article 299 ( 2 ) in practical terms . This coherent overall strategy should , we feel , enable the qualitative leap forward , which your report , Minster , demands .
The EU Social Policy Agenda recognises that re-training opportunities must be given in the field of technology and Internet activities for the existing workforce .
This , Mr President , is why it is necessary for the Commission - and I would ask Commissioner Patten to give an incisive response - to make good use of these amendments to the European Union 's budget that were tabled by our Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party in respect of the 2000 budget .
The impact this may have on the health and reproduction of both humans and wildlife is worrying , with children , pregnant workers and other vulnerable workers being some of the most sensitive groups .
There can , for example , be no doubt that the effects of radiation cause cancer of the thyroid , as in the case of the depleted uranium bombs used in Yugoslavia .
The EU is ever more dependent upon the goodwill of other countries to let us fish . We knew five years ago this situation would arise .
But as concerns Eurojust , this is a network for coordinating the actions of national judges and public prosecutors with the objective of enhancing capabilities for combating types of serious crime at European level .
Such is the case in connection with credit card payments , tracing the movement of mobile telephones , storing telephone connections , surfing on the internet , processing other data taken , for instance , from forms previously filled in etc .
. ( FR ) My comments as to this person 's Nordic or Mediterranean origins were made in response to a quip made by the President - it was a quip in itself .
I emphasise - to Mr Mulder , Mr Blak , Mrs van der Laan , Mrs Morgan and to all the other speakers who have expressed themselves on this issue - that the Court will continue to develop that .
The operation of social systems is directly affected by certain general trends including the unemployment and social exclusion generated by 25 years of low economic growth , which has restricted the overall potential tax yield , the ageing of the population , the consequence of the emergence of new diseases and , finally , increased health care costs due to advances in medical research and treatment .
We have talked enough about the procedural aspect and the ins and outs of the whole BSE issue .
In our fight to create a strong and dynamic green electricity market , the first thing we have to do is listen , so that we can learn from each other .
We have now reached the pinnacle of confusion , as became abundantly clear from yesterday 's statements by the French minister , Mr Patriat , and the European Commissioner , Mr Byrne , who both seem to be completely at a loss .
Mr President , my colleague , Mr von Wogau , and I would seem to share something more than just the same opinion today .
It is very much up to the American administration to tell us with whom we should speak .

Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission and Parliament have in recent years made great efforts to achieve harmonisation in the levying of VAT within the European Union .
My reasoning is that I believe there is a greater potential for public / private partnerships as there is a huge commercial value to be exploited on the market in the interest both of companies and citizens .
We hope the passage of the report will also lead to early suspension of the trade sanctions imposed by the USA , which operate in quite arbitrary and unrelated sectors .
Therefore , this joint resolution , which is objective , clear , shows genuine concern and is not demagogic , has the earnest support of my political group ; sharing an economic , social and political diagnosis in which its concerns are well-founded , it does not allow any other interpretation of its text that may divide the Mozambican people .
I also think that when we are looking at the quality of education we need to see if it is delivering real equality of opportunity for all of those within the system or whether it is doing , as society does , so much to exclude people on grounds of a poor background or their colour or whatever .
I have voted in favour of the report and especially of Amendment No 1 from Mr van Dam .
There is , in my view , a difference between this conflict and the other conflicts in Indonesia and also some difference in the character of the response of the Indonesian Government .
Mr President , I just want to take the opportunity of asking Commissioner Wallström and others to speak in their respective native languages here in the Chamber - in Mrs Wallström 's case , Swedish .
It was good to hear of the ambitions of the Swedish Presidency here today .
If we are going to control the speed at which people drive , it does make quite a difference whether the limit we set is 100 or 200 kilometres per hour .
Madam President , there is a lot of talk about quotas in Mrs Karamanou 's report .
A solution , a largely financial solution , will have to be found for the band of intermediate regions , and what I am seeking to do is to ask the questions to obtain the help I need in order to find appropriate solutions when the time comes .
Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating all those who made the agreement we are discussing this afternoon possible . Firstly the two rapporteurs , Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Swoboda , then the French Presidency and finally the Commission , more particularly the Commissioner , who is present this afternoon .
Madam President , I simply wish to confirm Mr Howitt 's words .
I would caution all interested parties against discussing broader developments within the Union before the ratification process has been comprehensively concluded within the European Union .
I would lastly express some reservations about Amendment No 11 .
There is no question that this House and the other European institutions will be taking their responsibilities to the people of Europe seriously when they approve this legislation tomorrow .
Mr Bullmann has stressed this global vision , a vision that I share absolutely , to which , of course , the Commission 's synthesis report responds .
I therefore feel that the best thing would be to place our trust in these bodies and wait for them to analyse the case properly , seeing as I imagine the matter is of interest to all the Members in this Chamber .
Nonetheless , the number of immigrants is rising , begging the conclusion that it really is time to create optimum conditions in the European Union , otherwise conflicts may intensify .

It is anticipated that this committee will report back to the Greater London Assembly by the summer .
This solidarity between Member States with regard to reception is reflected in the principle of voluntary action by both sides .
Despite all Parliament 's requests over the years and the commitment demonstrated by Commissioner Barnier and Commissioner Schreyer in particular , this subject was not even on the agenda at Nice .
We will indeed have to look again at the Commission 's original proposal for emission ceilings in 2004 and decide whether it would be better to share the burden differently in the light of more recent developments .
I fully support the establishment of a European crime prevention network by the last French Presidency and the current Swedish Presidency , which demonstrates the EU 's commitment to combating crime and protecting our citizens .
The report rightly stresses the need to promote economic growth and trade in Ukraine , but for this the conditions must be right .

It is an excellent system and , incidentally , we could save the taxpayers some money by using it .
The Commission notes with satisfaction the Committee 's proposal that a combination of both legislative and voluntary remedies should be used in any future strategy . Of interest too is the proposal for drafting legislation on PVC that would only enter into force if the players concerned are unable to meet the set objectives through voluntary agreements .
I welcome the adoption by the European Parliament of the report by German Socialist MEP Dagmar Roth-Berendt , which calls for a ban on the testing of animals and the introduction of proper labelling so that consumers can make an informed choice .
They have , for instance , consisted of the distribution of essential medicines to health providers , training of doctors on rational drug use , rehabilitation of basic health care facilities and the distribution of hygiene parcels .

Mr President , as you know , today is the eleventh World Press Freedom Day .
In actual fact , it is quite incredible that this method of production has been accepted until now .
Under the water directive , the criteria for the identification of such substances focus firstly on their inherent characteristics and secondly on the definitions contained in the existing international , UN , OSPAR and other lists .
Nonetheless , we agree that the intervention ceiling should be abolished for the years 2001 and 2002 .
Mr Lamy should guarantee that administrative arrangements will prevent hygiene rules being used as a disguised form of protectionism and , at the same time , apply rules of origin which prevent fraud but enable LDCs to add value to their raw materials .
The Union has always emphasised the importance of complementarity between European action and Alliance action , especially in relation to the Petersberg tasks .
This is why our group recommends that we adopt this report , without undermining its current balance .
Mr President , first I would like to thank Mr Ferber for an excellent report .
The Commission is proposing in the longer term to introduce aid-per-tree instead of per ton of olive oil .
Genuine consultation obviously requires information to be readily available to workers ' representatives and to be of practical value , such as the opportunity to hold meetings , to have access to experts , or to request support from unions .
Some new inspiration , some groundswell , must reinvigorate the old method of intergovernmental negotiation .
I am perhaps slightly disappointed by the view of the PPE-DE .
Like previous speakers , I should like to emphasise the value of the activity report . I should also like , however , to draw attention to its weakness , which lies in its lack of critical evaluation .

The Commission will monitor future developments with the utmost attention to make sure that all parties act in respect for democratic principles and human rights , in conformity with the basic provisions of Article 1 of the EC-Nepal Cooperation Agreement .
The facts of the matter , and the present economic climate which I referred to earlier are as follows , especially for our products .
In these circumstances , the Council ultimately becomes intransigent and adopts a position that always implies : either you do what we say or the law will not be adopted .
Nonetheless we need to ensure that we get the minor amendments properly sorted out before embarking on the more wide-ranging reform which we will see in the Solvency II regulation .
It is also important that the medium-term efforts and the Union 's responsibility in this area - the association agreement is clearly an important factor - make positive progress .
That problem has also been highlighted in this House on several occasions , but what is the latest on the trade agreements , and what exactly is going on in that country in terms of human rights ?

Mr President , Commissioner , there is no doubt that over the years , the Cohesion Fund has helped to make less developed regions within the Union stronger .
Madam President , the pictures we have seen in recent days from Afghanistan are of course clear evidence that the problem does not go away but that the flow of refugees unfortunately continues as a direct result of the policy we are pursuing here in our part of the world .
Europe has an old and antiquated system in which all towns wanted to have their industries and it seemed that quality of life was linked to everything being together .
I note in particular , for example , that Paragraph 13 of the report , " takes the view that the various historical , economic and social features in the individual Member States make it impossible to lay down a uniform requirement in labour from third countries which would cover the entire territory of the Union and that , furthermore , the Union has no powers in law in this field . "
Question No 43 by ( H-0710 / 01 ) :

It is simply not true that inflation can create jobs .
An internal market for services has for a long time been a missing element in a European growth policy , a policy which must also be supplemented by measures to speed up the liberalisation process in sectors such as postal services , electricity and energy - something which cannot be said too often .
I must emphasise the work undertaken by so many Members of this House .
Some of the proposed amendments , and indeed what has been said by some Members just now , seems to imply that by using the definition , " the public concerned " , both the convention and the Commission are deliberately restricting the rights of citizens , but may I be permitted to point out that is certainly not the case .
I wish to know why the Bureau has gone against the spirit of what was accepted in the plenary both on the van Hulten report and on the Harbour report and why , given the critical importance and interinstitutional nature of this issue , the Vice-President for Reform , Commissioner Kinnock , was not invited to speak at that meeting .
Why has the Council , with a Commission proposal valued at EUR 197 million , not budgeted for it ?
Is that what other countries can expect from a Council ?
The events of recent months and weeks have shown , whatever may have been said about them this morning , that the European Union is becoming , and is being perceived to be , an increasingly important player on the world stage .
Could this be a case of 'doublespeak ' ?
There is a report with which you are probably familiar , I hope you are , which says that we will at best achieve 5% over the full MAGP period and even that is very unlikely .

This approach is entirely consistent with Parliament 's point of view .
The amendments that we have constructively negotiated with the Commission and Council improve this proposal : the recognition that we need additional money , the fact that this is simply a first payment and the request to the Commission both to bring forward a legal base for future contributions and to provide a report so that some of these information issues can be dealt with .
Terrorism is not a recent phenomenon , but in recent years , we have seen an increase in terrorist activities , with a profound change in the nature of terrorist offences , with new threats arising , and with the use of new and much more sophisticated instruments , which has led to the real or potential effects of these attacks becoming increasingly devastating and deadly .
It is important that the food authority builds a comprehensive overview of the entire chain . This should include aspects of animal health and welfare , animal feed safety and plant health , in particular at the primary production level .

As a result , a supplement to the 1993-1996 protocol with Mauritania was adopted which aimed to offset the loss of fishing opportunities for the Community fleet in Morocco by allowing for 18 Spanish vessels to transfer to the waters of Mauritania , a geographical area close to where they operated previously .
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Commission :
How representative of European opinion are Valéry Giscard D'Estaing , Dehaene and Amato ?

In my opinion , the main cause of this situation lies in the rigidity of the system and the still weak consumer demand for 'green ' products .
I want to begin by saying thank you to Mr Stevenson who has talked in very clear terms about the experiences of the Committee on Fisheries ' delegation in Denmark and about how , in Denmark , it has been possible completely to remove the mystique from sand eel fishing , as well as to rebut the many assertions to the effect that it is industrial fishing that is destroying the food chain .
This is a very sensitive matter in which different Member States uphold different traditions .

Therefore , I would like to ask you whether you think that it would be more fruitful to improve the role of the Committee of the Regions in the Union 's work .

The next item is a joint debate on the following 28 motions for resolutions on human rights :
This notification order was forwarded first to the public prosecutor of the Republic at the level of the Court of First Instance , then through the public prosecutor at the Paris Court of Appeal and then from that public prosecutor to the Minister of Justice and by the Minister of Justice to the Parliament here .
What is and will continue to be crucial , is that human rights are safeguarded in practice and that Turkey , as regards day-by-day social coexistence guarantees the benchmarks of a democratic and pluralist society .
Therefore , the political centre of gravity at this time should be more than just currency , more than the CFSP , even , but the linking of citizens to the Community idea and the search for and protection of a European culture .
Mr President , the aim of this draft decision is to ensure the full implementation of Article 286 of the Amsterdam Treaty and of Regulation ( EC ) No 45 / 2001 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies , adopted under codecision procedure on 18 December 2000 .
The discussion on the Bene ? Decrees has encouraged me to continue with the Commission 's cautious way of dealing with this issue .
I appreciate the proposals in the report which would enable the views of NGOs to be heard far more systematically in the JPA 's proceedings .
I continue to be perplexed at our Taoiseach 's attempt to once again play the neutrality card in Barcelona in an effort to get the Nice Treaty supported .
In applying the definition of family members , it is important however that the principle of subsidiarity should prevail .
It is also necessary to continue the normalisation process with Taiwan without a show of arms , and China must comply with the content of the UN Conventions on Human Rights which have been signed .
It is , therefore , crucial that the European Union and its Member States give this commitment , incorporating issues of ageing into Community policies and including the elderly in their social , economic and development programmes , paying particular attention to elderly people at risk of isolation and by developing the principle of active ageing , promoting opportunities for the elderly to participate in social and cultural life . There are various ways in which this can be done , as Mrs Lambert has already mentioned .
Mrs Díez González ' report reminds us that we have agreements with human rights and democracy clauses yet we do nothing .
Despite the fact that , by definition , tourism goes beyond borders and is by definition an activity which is beyond a single Member State 's control .
I would like you to explain something in more detail .
Question No 15 by Anne E. M. Van Lancker ( H-0304 / 02 ) :
As regards today 's agenda , I want to inform the House that Mr Cortés , Secretary of State for international cooperation in Latin America , cannot be here before 5.30 p. m .
Just as the United States - sometimes they do get it right - has the FBI , Europe must also have its federal police , a police service that works properly , is not a waste of money and is close to the citizen .
We must therefore accept that tinkering with the electoral laws will not create an artificial feeling of belonging to the European Union or reduce the colossal abstention that affects the legitimacy of Parliament .
I would like to reiterate the European Council 's intention to deal with this issue by sending the most forthright and constructive possible message and I believe it is almost impossible to examine everything that is going to be dealt with at the Council in detail , but I believe this Council will be the culmination of an incredibly intense six-month period .
That stocks of both species are severely threatened has been disputed by nobody here this evening , and so , if we want to be consistent , hake must not be left out , and the sceptics should bear in mind that prevention is better than cure .
Is it broadcast on a European cinema television channel ?
In the meantime , we wish to make use of all our rights within the WTO to put pressure on the United States so that , as I said , we can obtain compensation and / or exemptions , so that the impact on our steel industries - as and when the Americans grant exemptions , which are , in fact , derogations to the tariff increases in aid of our exporters - is as positive as possible .
However , until they do , Europe must take the lead .
However , the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is going to support the approval of the percentages proposed , but maintaining the upper limits , because the proposal already provides for the possible exceeding of these limits with the permission of the Commission .
Doing so is important in that a number of problems remain to be solved during the last months of the year .
Moreover , the forthcoming summit will include , as an innovation , an informal breakfast debate under the heading , ' Dialogue Between Cultures and Civilisations ' .
That is precisely why we owe it to both Professor Ibrahim and the Egyptian people to get involved here .
This is about accountability and the proper functioning of democracy , where we as a Parliament are taking our responsibility in the budgetary process , using the reserve on a judicious basis to get the information that we need to be able to carry out our job effectively .
It is extremely important to move closer to reality .
In view of the foregoing , as members of the Communist Party of Greece , we consider that the ? U 's interest in the ICC , as expressed in the resolution put to the vote , is hypocritical and is just part of the game of standoff between the imperialist powers as they squabble over the spoils and we shall not be voting in favour of it .
Of course safety has to be guaranteed - there can be no question whatever about that .
We should therefore clarify and refine the Commission 's text , which is what Mrs Grossetête tried to do , rather than delete everything .
This is the EU 's position , and it seems to me , therefore , that the 15 governments have prepared themselves as well as possible for the discussions which are to take place at the European Council meeting in Brussels , and also for the subsequent talks with Russia which are to be conducted by the Presidency , and which will culminate in the EU-Russia Summit in Copenhagen in November .
Subject : Neighbouring country status for Ukraine
That is an inspiring task , and a responsibility that puts us under an obligation .
With the Stockholm Agreement , the countries of Northern Europe committed themselves to adapting their passenger ferries to more rigorous safety criteria than those currently in force , in order to make the ferries more stable , by means of certain construction measures , in the event of an accident at sea .
We cannot express regret that European citizens lack an interest in Europe whilst also rejecting the debate on enlargement , enlargement which would be the furthest removed from the European Union 's original plan .
It is true that there is an execution phase and a delegation phase , and that it could be argued that , since the execution falls to the Governments of the Member States , Parliament should get involved in this phase , which is outside the actual activity of control .
B5-0607 / 2002 by Mrs Izquierdo Rojo and Mr van den Berg , on behalf of the PSE Group , on the death sentence against Hashem Aghajari in Iran ;
Given the magnitude of the change - and this is important - we plan to have a transitional period , at the end of which the Secretary of the Union will take full charge of his duties . I would like to outline these briefly .
Are we supposed to use protective emergency vaccination at the right moment ?
That is an opportunity for Turkey , and I also believe that Turkey is capable of meeting these requirements .
There are marked distinctions to be drawn between the successes and failures in the various lines of business involved .
The first way involves national tensions or , in other words , undeclared protectionism . It also entails corporatism and national vote-winning measures .
President Karzai 's commitment at the 2 December Bonn II Conference to form an Afghan National Army is a welcome step forward , as is the recent signing of the Kabul Declaration on good-neighbourly relations .
We must set priorities in order to be able to fulfil our political and economic responsibilities in the world - for the Member States , the accession countries , and the surrounding countries .
And all the honourable Members of this House know that Dr Blix , a great European by the way - as he said himself yesterday ? and a man who believes in the values of Europe , spoke to you yesterday with a degree of pessimism in his heart .
I feel that , from this point of view , it is extremely significant that dialogue , which has thus far been greatly lacking between these two events , was represented by the presence of the Brazilian President , Mr Lula da Silva , who , in both cases , upheld the need for huge structural reform - the kind of reform that he has undertaken to carry out in his own country - of the world economic system , wholeheartedly condemning the empty principle of free trade at all costs , which only actually applies to the poor countries since the wealthy countries can afford to be protectionist whenever and however they want .
This is the case with the reduction of the scope of the system to just the Austrian Alps , which are genuinely of the greatest sensitivity , because in the other areas of Austria the sensitivity - and many of the speakers were right - is identical to that of other areas of Europe .
. ( EL ) The spread of illnesses such as HIV / AIDS and epidemics in the developing world has taken on genocidal proportions .
The most serious drug problems affect intravenous drugs users , of whom there are , according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction , between 500 000 and one million in the European Union .
Parliament 's position also took account of the different circumstances that exist in the Member States by making it possible to have temporary derogations .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Redondo Jiménez is right to say that , according to Article 3 of the Commission proposal , a farmer in receipt of direct payments has to comply with the basic requirements of farm management in accordance with Annex 3 of the proposal and has to ensure that the land is kept in good agricultural condition .
By the way , for Mr Gollnisch 's information , there are only 30 American personnel in the Macedonian force , and none of them are combat troops .
At present , the options for imposing sanctions under this article amount to nothing worse than the possibility of industries ' and Member States ' becoming liable for repaying the illegal aid .
I trust that tomorrow 's comments on the subject of the oral question will help to clarify the situation with regard to this threat to the pension plan for European Union civil servants .
I believe that is where we should address the demands and proposals we are making here in the European Union , but I would like to say that through this proposal , and the one we made previously , we are applying all the requirements not just for drivers from any of the European Union countries , but also for third-country drivers who operate in the European Union , in European Union companies .
And finally , what does the Commission intend to do when the Drugs system of generalised preferences expires in 2004 ?
I therefore see it as my responsibility as a German social democrat to set today 's European date of 9 April 2003 against the nationalist date of 1 September 1939 , at the same time hoping for peace and prosperity for all and for a European social model based on partnership .
Can the Commissioner now take this opportunity to say why the Commission changed its mind - on the basis of which scientific studies ?
The European Union 's common space policy is important . The European Space Agency is an essential part of European integration .
It is also a very dynamic country with major resources and a lot of talent , and continued cooperation between the EU and Turkey is in the interests of both Turkey and the EU .
The Greek Presidency has emphasised the importance of the European Rural Model and the foundations on which it is based , namely family farms and local communities , small towns and villages located throughout the EU 's rural areas .
Is now the moment to talk about the point Mr Poettering has raised , or will he submit it later ?
At the same time , we believe it is hypocritical to legislate on corporate governance while not being able to apply the same standards to an institution ultimately funded by taxpayers ' money .
As far as the other issue under consideration is concerned , I confess I am a little disappointed by the debate .
I refer to the European Council of 20 and 21 March . On the basis of these conclusions , the Council addressed this issue , as it did within the framework of the conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 19 May , when it reiterated this paragraph and , especially , the need to examine the possible creation within the framework of the Union of an intergovernmental defence capabilities development and acquisition agency .
This is an affront to the Zimbabwean people in need , as is the willingness of other African regimes to maintain contact with the regime .
Instead , it must be taken seriously and handled responsibly , and - above all , in the large group - there should be no getting carried away into complying with the interests of the industry .
As an aside , I should like to mention that we in Germany were interested to note that after Parliament 's decision on enlargement the Czech Government for example issued a statement on the injustice of expulsion , which is along the right lines and gives us hope that here too the process of reconciliation may reach a successful conclusion .
Where external measures were concerned , there was clearly less implementation in April of this year than for the same period of 2002 , and this is something that concerns us .
It is absolutely unacceptable that the US and Britain are allowed to gain advantage from illegal activities .
It is a known fact that these programmes refer to complementary actions as far as farming and rural development are concerned and the level of funding under the so-called second pillar is not only trivial , but also mainly profits those who exercise a business activity in the subsidised sectors of these programmes .
At the meeting , the Commission gave an undertaking - and I believe that we should stick to this line - to propose a draft text on this subject during the course of the year .
The June Movement has chosen not to vote in favour of the proposal to delete Article 4 , in spite of this meaning that the Commission will become the coordinating body in relation to agreements entered into by the individual Member State .
With regard to the draft proposal for a framework decision on the procedural safeguards given to suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings in the European Union , which has arisen as a result of the Green Paper published by the Commission on 19 February , the drafting of this proposal is now under way and the text will be available at the end of November , once it has been adopted by the Commission .
The resolution does not condemn the US blockade of Cuba because it is illegitimate , illegal under international law and has serious consequences for the economy and quality of life of the people of Cuba . Rather , it condemns the blockade because it 'is not a constructive approach to promoting change or reform of the Cuban regime ' .
Romania and Bulgaria would not be covered by the Dublin II Regulation until the Council had made a decision 'at a later date ' ( Article 6 . 2 of the proposal ) .
I am very glad that this House 's rapporteur , Mr Mulder , has noted that everything related to home affairs and justice policy in the European Union has a close connection with enlargement , and that he himself has already made some necessary proposals .
Although Luxembourg 's specific situation meant that it was allowed a temporary derogation , this is no reason to bring forward from 2010 to 2008 the second phase for the application of the minimum rates .
When we have the results of the Clean Air For Europe programme in a couple of years , we will be in a much better position to assess if , where and what action might be needed in order to improve air quality in a scientifically and economically justified manner .
As regards the report by Mr Queiró on defence equipment ( A5-0342 / 2003 ) , I have received a request from the UEN Group to refer this report back to committee pursuant to Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure .
- The next item is the vote .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to add my voice to the unanimous acclaim of this directive as important and fundamental - maybe the most important directive achieved in the current legislature .
Indeed , I am of the view that the transatlantic relationship has not yet adapted fully to the new set of circumstances which exist following the collapse of the Iron Curtain , the effective removal of a security threat to Europe from the East and the emergence of the United States as the world 's only superpower .
. The aim of both proposals for directives , one general and the other sectoral , is to replace the four existing texts in order to simplify and modernise EU provisions relating to the award of public contracts .
I agree with much of what Mrs Kaufmann said earlier in her reference to Kofi Annan 's speech to the European Parliament a few days ago .
Thank you , Mrs Fourtou ; if I am allowed , I will also add my personal congratulations , given that you spoke about an early conciliation .
- Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am speaking to you in my capacity as the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market 's rapporteur on the transparency directive .
And the whole of the ' Spinelli Treaty ' is full of references to citizens , to people .
Thank you for your attention .
Who cares ?
Yushchenko 's ' Our Ukraine ' coalition has tabled a vetting bill , one of the provisions of which states that anyone who criticises the Ukrainian Insurgent Army , or the UPA for short , will be prevented from holding a public position .
Last week , a major German daily newspaper polled its readership . Of the almost 380 000 readers who took part , 96% were opposed to the Constitution .
It is not a question of a new budget but of a kind of ' lifebelt ' , based on the proposal of the Luxembourg Presidency and intended to save this year 's budget .
We , in the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , are all in favour of partnership , friendship and dialogue with the Islamic world , but that cannot be a one-way street .
These things are precisely what we need to achieve - or at least to get closer to - the Lisbon objective by 2010 , that being to have 3 million Erasmus students and 150 000 Leonardo participants .
. Mr President , I too would like to add my thanks to the President of the Court of Auditors for his report .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the fresh outbreaks of avian influenza in Asian countries and in some European countries , following the slaughter of millions of birds in Italy and the Netherlands , give ample grounds for more effective preventative measures to be taken , and for appropriate steps to be taken to support Member States in the event of an outbreak .
Mr President , when , in 1999 , the Commission President promised us access to agendas and minutes in connection with the Commission 's meetings , officials with excessively centralising tendencies immediately set about putting together new agendas with fewer points , together with distinctly pared down minutes , while the real agendas and the most complete minutes remained secret for a number of years .
Mr President , whilst we set out with a premature proposal by the committee , under Mr Jarzembowski 's leadership , a sound package of amendment proposals was thrashed out with built-in certainty , with more certainty for companies and port workers , and without self-handling .
As a Member of the European Parliament , who , together with my colleagues , Mrs Pleš tinská and Mr Ga ľ a , has adopted a Cuban political prisoner , I am keen to see greater pressure exerted on Fidel Castro through international public opinion .
In the interim , it would be appropriate to come to an arrangement at least over what is referred to as local border traffic .
- Mr President , Mr Barroso , Mr Winkler , ladies and gentlemen , I take a positive view of the fact that the European Union is using its weight to ensure that the whole is worth more than the sum of its parts , by boosting research and development to release the potential of companies , to foster enlargement and the best possible use of the quality of the labour force , with measures intended to secure energy supplies - but this is all subject to one basic premise : the added value of Europe can only emerge fully if it is the product of the work of a genuinely united European society and economy and if the results are achieved through the ' core business ' of the European Union .
Mr President , the EU 's shambolic liberalisation of the energy market has already resulted in gross distortions .
Mr President , I should like to mention the decision taken late last week by the British Government to sell the British Nuclear Group and put it into private ownership . This would mean that the Sellafield nuclear facility would end up in private ownership .
Madam President , the European Parliament must be the standard bearer for better legislation .
. Mr President , Mr Gorbach , ladies and gentlemen , the debate on the agenda concerns two issues : road safety and security measures in the transport sector .
. Mr President , Mr Winkler , Mrs Ferrero-Waldner , ladies and gentlemen , I confess to having doubts about the way in which EU policy is shaping up in the difficult situation in the Middle East .
The Council has informed me - and I am passing this information on to you - that it will not be able to stay here beyond 7.00 p. m .
Commissioner , I have a personal dilemma : I represent a country that is pro-enlargement but a region that is urging me to vote against Bulgarian membership .
. I shall be happy to deal with this issue in somewhat more detail although , if I have been correctly informed , I shall be able to adopt a more thorough position on it at 9 p. m. today , the Council having said that it is prepared still to be in this House at that time and to take part in this debate .
. Mr President , the Treaty on European Union states that the accession of new Member States to the euro zone is their right and obligation , as Commissioner Almunia just said .
Mr President , at this juncture I should like to express my special thanks to Commissioner Dimas and in particular to his staff and to the shadow rapporteur for their excellent cooperation in the drafting of this report .
I would remind the House of the ' Sound of Europe ' conference at the start of the Austrian Presidency , and also of an event that , in my opinion , can definitely be called a success - the ( European Café ) event that was held at the same time in all the capitals on Europe Day .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the European citizens and the researchers on the approval of the Buzek report on the Seventh Framework Programme .
Allow me to list three conditions - at an educational level and in terms of providing spurs to action and , if I may say so , tempting incentives - that are necessary if this preparation phase is to succeed .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as the Council has been asked for an opinion on this matter , I am happy to take part in this debate on its behalf .
. Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the European Parliament 's Committee on International Trade , while I note what the Commissioner has just said about the excellent climate of cooperation and joint work between Parliament and the Commission , I would like in this case to express my regret about a small incident relating to the formal communication of this proposal to Parliament for information , which has prevented us from reacting properly , although we are still in time .
From the start , I have fought in favour of the Commission 's initial proposal being separated into two headings : ' drug addiction ' and ' violence against women ' .
- Mr President , Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner , ladies and gentlemen , Europe is the region in the world with the greatest buying power , and that speaks for itself .
It covers the traditional skills such as literacy and information communication technologies - digital grammar - but it also goes beyond them by including skills which are important for citizenship , for living together in more and more varied societies .
On the subject of immigration , Günther Beckstein , the Bavarian Interior Minister , made a disastrous error when he claimed that it would not be too much to expect Spain to take in 25 000 people , for what matters is not whether or not it is reasonable that they should be expected ; the real point is that the fate of people - people in desperate need - waiting offshore , is at stake .
Ladies and gentlemen , nanotechnologies and nanosciences are to the 21st century what the Internet was to the 20th century . We cannot afford to again experience the European paradox which we have seen in the past .
- Mr President , I would like to raise the issue of water shortages , which is becoming an important matter for many citizens of Europe .
I know that the Commission is to make a statement tomorrow , but perhaps the Commissioner responsible for the budget and budget control could say something now about this 'spend , spend , spend ' approach .
This would increase the security of gas supply throughout the whole of Northern Europe , the Baltic States and other Member States of the European Union , and would accordingly reduce the need for nuclear power .
But nearly half our population consists of children , young people , pensioners , the unemployed or the sick and , however we approach the problem , these 50% will need to be cared for by the 50% who are gainfully employed , in other words the real rate of taxation - the burden of care - will effectively work out at around 50% , whether we collect taxes or not .
Training becomes a necessity that lasts all one 's life .
Finally , on the subject of imports from non-Community countries , these are extremely important for the fish processing industry .
I shall end by saying that in terms of actual reconstruction , the results of the European Union 's action can be seen in Mostar , although there are serious political problems , such as the lack of reunification .
The next item is the report ( A4-0187 / 96 ) by Mr Lehne , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights , on the first report from the Commission on the implementation of the money laundering directive ( 91 / 308 / EEC ) ( COM ( 95 ) 0054 - C4-0137 / 95 ) .
It has initiated a high-quality dialogue with the developing countries and worked for the recognition and application of women 's rights .
We hope of course that there will be many who do the same , because the environment is the future , whether we like it or not .
In order to carry out his duties ( and perhaps ensuring that he does carry out his duties 'effectively ' ) , a Member of Parliament receives various forms of compensation . They are justified and they are amply sufficient !
It is very unjust because we are short of sheep .
Without in any way wishing to call the rapporteur 's objectivity into question , I consider it inappropriate in principle that Parliament 's rapporteur should come from the same country as that in which support is to be assessed .
On the contrary , I think that this could have been one of the last opportunities to put a stop to the international trade in wild plant and animal species which is plundering our planet - but the opportunity has now been lost .
Regulation 307 / 91 allows the European Union to accord the Member States ECU 20 million annually to help them develop controls on the implementation of EAGGF-Guarantee Section spending within their territory .
I wish , in particular , to extend my thanks to the Committee on Culture and , above all , to Mrs Mouskouri who has bolstered , by means of her amendments , some of the fundamental points in the Commission 's initial proposal .
When Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi 's party organized an eighth anniversary celebration on 26 September at her house , at which she was also to give a speech , almost 600 people were arrested , including many sitting members of parliament , that is to say members who were elected but have not been allowed to take their seats in parliament .
Mr Carlos Arturo Marulanda is Colombia 's ambassador to the European Union .
I note with some concern that , on this subject , there is no real consensus in the European Parliament and the outcome of tomorrow 's vote will show that we must continue trying to find a common position between the different groups in the European Parliament .
The report makes numerous suggestions about the role of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) .
In accordance with fisheries agreements , it is for the State - the Senegalese state in this case - to decide what to do with anything paid over by the Community .
If there are any further problems with the clock , we will use you as a timer-keeper , but as the clock is now working I can guarantee that our next speaker , Mrs Bennasar , on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party , will have her allotted period of three minutes measured with complete accuracy .
It is worth bearing in mind that the programme is geared towards a further development and modernization of the Customs authorities of the 15 EU countries with a view to ensuring effective control at the EU 's outer borders and , thereby , a better management of the internal market .
It needs to specify the guarantees , controls and sanctions including - when necessary - the use of military force .
We must keep up the pressure which this Union is exerting in the name of universal human rights and application of the Council of Europe 's conventions on plurality of the media .
That means , among other things , a genuine procedure of codecision between the European Parliament and the Council , the abolition of the unanimous vote , the establishment of the Commission at the centre of the Union 's institutional system and a tougher cooperation clause to prevent any future deadlock or paralysis .
I am referring to research , the establishment of an inventory of forestry assets , measures to prevent damage to Europe 's forests from air pollution , joint measures against forest fires , all of which complement national and individual measures .
Everyone should understand that codification will at the same time facilitate better application of the Community 's rules and make Community law more accessible and more comprehensible to Europe 's citizens .
Discussions on this must take account of broader issues such as food supply , farmers ' incomes and environmental protection .
And if she does not answer you , because eight months have passed , Mr President-in-Office , how does the Council intend to react ? And a final question relating to recent statements by Mrs Çiller : what is the Council 's position on statements by Mrs Çiller that unless the European Union goes ahead with talks on Turkey 's accession to the EU , Turkey will never allow Cyprus to accede to the European Union ?
More especially , the Commission confirms that the agreement is on the one hand fully consistent and compatible with the orders of Regulation 3254 / 91 , and on the other hand entirely in accordance with the Council 's instructions to the Commission in June 1996 .
Question No 2 by Mr Camisón Asensio ( H-0103 / 97 )
I noticed from Mr Tillich 's draft report that the Commission and Parliament agree on the need to support the Member States in their efforts to meet the convergence criteria .
I believe that this represents substantial progress in our relations with the Commission , and I therefore think that it is very important that this statement - and , as I understand it , this has already been agreed - really can take place at 3 p. m . , in other words , right at the beginning of the April II sitting .
This proposal on the resale right sends out a very clear political message , and that is quite simply the European Union 's insatiable desire for expansion , or to put it in EU speech : the proposal violates both the principle of subsidiarity and the principle of proportionality .
I would mention that in only three Member States - Italy , the United Kingdom and Ireland - is there a definition of indirect discrimination in national legislation , and the proposals for amendments which we are presenting relate in particular to a judgment which was a milestone in this matter , namely 'Bilka ' ; similarly , the amendments to Article 4 , which highlight one of the fundamental elements in shifting the burden of proof , namely transparency , relate to the 'Danfoss ' judgment .
They may be - and in many cases are - activities of resistance in which craftsmen continue to be very closely linked to their tools and means of work , and this is not always compatible with a business activity such as it is presented in these reports .
However , we are extremely concerned , suspicious and distrustful as regards one point which has already been raised by both the rapporteur and Mr Bowe : this is the problem which Mrs Jensen referred to as Commission declarations in the Council 's minutes .
I can assure Mr Oostlander that time and time again in talks with these countries - and I know how we have been criticized for this approach , not least from the capitals of the countries themselves - the European Union has assured them that our policy must not be seen as an attempt to restore the old federal structure to Yugoslavia .
These taxes are already before Parliament but have come out of the Commission ( not from Commissioner Papoutsis or from Commissioner Monti ) with an objective which seems to me to be laudable : we must create jobs , which is a major problem for the Union , and we must reduce the burdens on businessmen in terms of energy .
The Parliament 's involvement in the framework of Article K.6 is an imperfect one and depends on the goodwill of the Presidency .
We have therefore amended and supplemented the Commission 's half-hearted proposal .
The next item on the agenda is the debate on the oral questions tabled by Mrs Theato on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control and by Mr Bontempi on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs to the Council ( B4-0168 / 97 ) and to the Commission ( B4-0169 / 97 ) on the establishment of a European legal and judicial area to protect the European Union 's financial interests against international crime .
Hundreds of people are still in prison , and I believe that economic measures , the pressure that would be exerted if no money from the European Union were invested there , if Europe did not support the regime in any way , could secure these people 's release from prison .
As regards the first objective - taking Europe closer to the citizens and overcoming the democratic deficit - timid steps have been taken far short of what was expected .
All this naturally gives rise to a great many problems and I would be grateful for the Commissioner 's opinion regarding my specific questions .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , the European Transport Safety Council has presented to the Commission - and , I assume , also to the Council - its celebrated plan which includes the ambitious objective of reducing the number of road accident victims in the European Union from 45 , 000 to 25 , 000 a year by 2010 .
We know that the death rate from alcoholism is the highest in Europe and that alcohol is the most dangerous drug for European citizens , particularly when people drink and drive , endangering their own and other people 's lives .
As you know , following the major restructuring authorized by the European Union , CSI is a completely reorganized company with no debts , with 10 , 000 million in the bank . It was restructured socially ( at Spanish taxpayers ' expense , by the way ) and at the moment it is in a privileged position compared with other large companies such as Usinor , Arbed , Thyssen or British Steel .
Mr President , the Commission 's initiative on commerce is extremely well-judged , as is the position taken by the European Parliament based on the report by Mr Garosci , whom I also congratulate .
Firstly , the difficulties in financing social security systems that may be encountered in the future - I am here replying to Mr de Lassus - will be demographic ones .
In some areas , it creates an essential framework of reference for Member States ' actions .
In fact , the Maastricht Treaty provided the blueprint for the evolution towards a parliamentary system . The Amsterdam Treaty continued this trend by strengthening the European Parliament 's legislative powers and requiring the President of the Commission - whose position was also strengthened - to have the confidence of Parliament .
It is therefore right to make bringing this directive into force depend on perfecting a technique for detecting vegetable fats other than cocoa butter in chocolate .
Today , I wish to extend those thanks , since , in the meantime , and on the basis of the proposals drawn up by the European Parliament 's Committee on Women 's Rights , the Portuguese Parliament has adopted a new law - which has just entered into force - which goes far beyond the draft directive that we are discussing today .
Just on the record of attendance , Mr President , I was here yesterday , I think you may have noticed that .
And , of course , you have to criticize the fact that Euratom has been totally overlooked too .
That call is repeated tonight in Mr Secchi 's report and was repeated in Mrs Randzio-Plath 's report to which the Commissioner referred earlier .
Budgetary agreements such as last Thursday 's make the Committee on Budgets deeply suspicious of the Council 's attitude .
This point continued to cause friction and in the end we made a compromise in which , after three years , the Commission will draft a report on the state of affairs regarding small businesses , and we , after having received the report , will then be able to examine whether they - and this includes small shopkeepers - will have to meet those obligations , or whether we might decide to prolong the general exception for such tiny businesses as corner shops .
The first hope is that Turkey , despite its negative behaviour all these years and its peevish reaction to yesterday 's decisions of the 15 Member States , will realise that nobody is denying its position in Europe and that it is its own activities and oversights that , since 1963 , have prevented the upgrading of its relations .
And I would also like to remind everyone that the European community institutions , including this Parliament , continued to defend the Yugoslav utopia to its dying day , until Germany was the only country the have the courage to chose the side of the Croatian people .
The Danish Social Democrats have today voted for John Steven 's report concerning electronic money in the countries which take part in the third phase of economic and monetary union .
on the Cabrol recommendation ( A4-0004 / 98 )
At the present time the situation is such that most of the accent is being placed on the Munich-Verona route where an impossibly expensive , 20 km long mega tunnel is being proposed .
The next item is the report by Mr Pettinari ( A4-0007 / 98 ) on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Yemen .
So what we must do is keep the proposals made by the Auto-Oil programme , as they set out a restrictive framework for the short term . What is most important is to implement them .
B4-0184 / 98 by Mr Bertinotti and others , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group , on the Cermis tragedy ; -B4-0187 / 98 by Mr Dell 'Alba , on behalf of the are Group , on the Cermis tragedy ; -B4-0209 / 98 by Mr Bianco and others , on behalf of the PPE Group , on the Cermis accident ; -B4-0210 / 98 by Mr Azzolini and Mr Santini , on behalf of the UPE Group , on the accident in Italy caused by an American military plane ; -B4-0221 / 98 by Mr Bertens , on behalf of the ELDR Group , on the Cavalese catastrophe ; -B4-0243 / 98 by Mrs Aglietta and others , on behalf of the V Group , on the Cermis tragedy ; -B4-0250 / 98 by Mr Colajanni and others , on behalf of the PSE Group , on the death of 20 people caused by an American plane in Cavalese ( Italy ) .
The introduction of 30 km / h zones in residential areas and around schools saves many children 's lives .
Mr President , as rapporteur for Slovakia I agree with the Commission 's approach for the proposed partnership agreements with Slovakia .
Article 3 , in fact , which is legally incorrect , at least in Spanish , talks about " finalidad ' , or purpose .
The next item is the vote on the report ( A4-86 / 98 ) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna .
The European Union 's single main tool for fighting against exclusion from the labour market is the Integra Community employment initiative within the Structural Funds .
I am happy to extend Question Time on some other occasion . I was not responsible for the delay today .
In their now famous appeal , seven European magistrates underlined the fact that alongside the visible , official and respectable Europe being built - to quote them - there was a hidden and much darker Europe , that of the Mafia and criminal activities .
In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , we have started discussing the Commission 's action plan with regard to textiles and clothing , a plan which seems inadequate to deal with the problems in the sector .
In accordance with the position of the Finnish Central Party , we oppose the creation of EMU in its present form and Finland 's entry into the single currency in the first wave .
It is good to see European Parliament amendments incorporated into the common position .
The limit values in the Commission proposal will thus turn out to be " wish values ' .
Mr President , since the outset this report has created a certain feeling of uneasiness , as also demonstrated by our President , Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado 's speech , an extremely rare event in a public sitting . He thinks the text goes against the Treaty and Parliament 's Rules of Procedure .
Regretfully , the report fails to mention , for want of effectiveness , any individual action by a Member State to the benefit of the whole of Europe , as in the case of Italy with regard to the Albanian crisis .
Finally , I wish to raise once again the matter of the choice of legal base , which should be Article 100a and not Article 130s ( 1 ) .
The next item is the recommendation for second reading ( A4-0226 / 98 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy , on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Decision concerning the Fifth Framework Programme of the European Community for research , technological development and demonstration activities ( 1998-2002 ) ( C4-0182 / 98-97 / 0119 ( COD ) ) ( Rapporteur : Mrs Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl ) .
Mr Henderson , I invite you to reply to Mr Titley 's question .
For Denmark in particular there is an historical dependence which was encouraged by the Danish Government , and any measures to change the balance - with which I agree - should be matched by compensatory measures .
Moreover , it is a matter of the utmost urgency , in view of the forthcoming elections in 1999 , that the obstacles to exercising the right to vote in European Union elections which still exist in some Member States , and which are generally of a simply administrative nature , should be eliminated .
I must say that since this communication was adopted on 9 September 1997 there has been a swift and unprecedented move to set up new EEIGs : the number has risen rapidly from 800 ( the figure at that time ) to 966 within in a short space of time .
It seems to be a quirk of history that the very same German government that worked to achieve a European competition law in the 1980s is no longer prepared to accept EU decisions in the 1990s .
I would also like to express my appreciation for the way in which he has achieved compromises in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights . He is ultimately the initiator of this private Member 's legislation .
I hope that Parliament will follow the recommendations in Mr Elchlepp 's very good report , and respond positively to the Czech request to use Phare funds for this purpose , as in the case of other applicant countries such as Hungary , Romania , Poland and the Slovak Republic .
I give the floor to the Commissioner to answer Mr Seppänen 's question .
In autumn last year , the federal minister presented a draft convention on trafficking to the UN General Assembly .
This is a question of principle : under no circumstances can the European Union allow members of parliament , freely elected in elections regarded as free by the local population , to be unilaterally prevented from exercising their function .
It provides the Central Bank with the means with which to restrict the commercial banks ' lending activities and to control the money supply .
I really do think that action should finally be taken - in the interests of Brussels and Belgium as well - to stop this kind of thing happening !
The programme concerns rare diseases , i. e. those with fewer than five cases per 10 000 people .
The 1997-1999 programmes obviously maintain continuity with those of 1994-1996 .
It is also a clear sign that the international community will also help other countries - if it proves necessary - which means we have good reason to evaluate Latin America 's future realistically and also positively .
We are debating the twenty-sixth financial report on the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund , Guarantee Section ( 1996 financial year ) , submitted by the Commission under Article 10 of Regulation No 729 .
In our opinion the traditional distinction between initial training and continuous training or , indeed , the distinction between formal and informal education , also needs to be broken down by simplifying bureaucratic procedures and creating close and continuous links between the Community and national spheres by means of the Structural Funds , especially the European Social Fund . Cooperation measures in the field of youth constitute a crucial keystone in the active integration of young people and the promotion of citizenship of Europe .
Mr President , I should like to point out to Mr Rack that the Commission has proposed continuing and reinforcing the Community 's Interreg initiative . It believes that in future this should comprise three forms of cooperation .
So please increase the 'de minimis ' rule as you have already promised to do .
In this situation , it is necessary firstly from a political point of view for Turkey to take the opportunity for dialogue , to which Akin Birdal has always referred ; secondly , from a humanitarian point of view , it is necessary for Akin Birdal - the victim of a shady assassination attempt , as a result of which he is still suffering - to be given access to medical care in Europe too .
Mr President , after so many years we have come as far as this evening 's debate on the Rothley report , in the sincere hope that we are approaching the beginning of the end .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Dührkop Dührkop , who was very receptive to the proposals from the Committee on Women 's Rights , which sought , above all , to enshrine the concept of mainstreaming in the budgetary procedure , in other words to incorporate equal opportunities for men and women into all European policies .
I should like to address Mr Schüssel , President-in-Office of the Council and ask him , during his reply here in Parliament and not in secret meetings between governments , to address Greek farmers directly - I am raising this particular subject - and give them an assurance ...
Mrs Green , I have allowed you to announce your motion of censure and state your Group 's position twice . But I stopped you when you began a debate on the matter .
As regards the amendments tabled by Parliament , the Commission considers that many of them enhance and clarify the original proposal still further , and it can therefore accept Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 and 17 which were tabled by the rapporteur Mr Evans on behalf of the Committee on Culture , as well as Amendment No 14 .
I would like to know if there is any indication that markets themselves are responding to what is an increasing number of single people perhaps just looking for 'the blessed peace of the single bed ' , to quote George Bernard Shaw .
This applies , for example , to the sensitive issue of feed . In principle , this should be entirely organic in this type of production , and in this respect the Commission 's proposal is already sufficient derogation in itself , since it recommends 90% organic feed .
Mr President , I object because this changes the meaning of the paragraph and I do not think we should do this orally .
This smacks of hypocrisy , given all our talk of defending the financial interests of the European Union . Mrs Cresson and Mr Marín may have redirected a few pence here or there , like any good socialist , but in this case , 14 billion francs have been given as gifts to a multinational firm , Chiquita .
We should remember that the modifications to the present directive only concern fuel tanks made of plastic material , and that there is therefore no need to invalidate any approval already granted under the directive . Nor is there any need to refuse the registration , sale or entry into service of new vehicles with metal liquid-fuel tanks approved under existing harmonisation arrangements .
I think it was Baron Lamfalussy who said that in the process of building a single currency there were more 'ifs ' and more conditionals than in the famous poem 'If ' by Rudyard Kipling .
The real test will come when the EU bans meat containing hormones in a few weeks ' time .
Madam President , ever since the abolition of apartheid in South Africa , the leaders of the European Union have constantly given President Mandela assurances that a fair agreement on trade would be concluded - a much-needed , strategic agreement which would encourage development in the poorest regions of South Africa , and which is of the utmost importance for the peace , stability and development of the whole southern African region .
It is the last International Women 's Day of this century . A declaration on the situation of women , and especially on violence against women , is thus appropriate .
This study will serve as a scientific basis for the new 'chocolate ' directive which is being prepared .
Indeed it must , but at the present time it must act without interfering in the forthcoming elections ; otherwise , we will be acting contrary to our objectives .
I also support Bartho Pronk 's request for minimum European standards for certain social provisions , as well as a structured process of voluntary consultation at European level on the objectives and policies related to social protection , especially as regards the European employment strategy that was adopted at the Luxembourg summit .
It has attracted attention , not because of its aims and purpose to be the flagship for the European Union 's vocational training policy , but because it has become associated with mismanagement , fraud , secrecy and nepotism .
The report 's main objective is instead to advance the federalist cause .
The Commission proposals simply apply the term 'reduction ' across the board for all agricultural products .
The next item is the report ( A4-0111 / 99 ) by Mrs Schmidbauer , on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , on the Commission White Paper entitled 'Fair Payment for Infrastructure Use : A phased approach to a common transport infrastructure charging framework in the EU ' ( COM ( 98 ) 0466 - C4-0514 / 98 ) .
The next item is the report ( A4-0210 / 99 ) by Mr Wijsenbeek , on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities , on the request for the waiver of Mr Féret 's parliamentary immunity .
However , although I appreciate the political problem which the Macedonian Government has , I do not think its attitude to the deportees at the frontier is acceptable - and nor would it be acceptable in any circumstances .
We support the move to a new personnel policy under which promotion would be performance based .
Mr President , I should like to take this opportunity to express my annoyance , and annoyance is too mild a word , because I think it is outrageous that a report which was scheduled for this morning - at least that is what I was given to understand when we voted on the agenda on Monday - should now be postponed .
It is a paradox that , as the Union 's importance grows , co-operation among its governments in the Council is being threatened as powers are fragmented and compartmentalised .
The European Union is in a paradoxical situation .
I must say , therefore , that I regard it as my duty to my electors and to my conscience to vote against endorsing this Commission .
We look forward to our first reading next month when the Council will get a pretty good idea of our opinion of its draft budget .
In these historic days when the Basques are opting for European construction as a democratic path to understanding , conciliation and peaceful co-existence with all Spaniards , as well as all the other peoples of Europe , the thing that we need least , the thing that could affect the peace which we are seeking and which we yearn for is for our remaining fiscal sovereignty , our economic harmony , not to be respected .
We also know that France , Great Britain and Portugal have announced their readiness to send troops .
For that reason , I would like to make three points . Firstly , we do not need two administrative bodies for one agency ; secondly , decision-making must be carried out where the work is being done , that is to say at the Kosovo Reconstruction Agency in Kosovo ; and thirdly , it is important to work in co-operation with the local people and , more particularly , on a multi-ethnic basis , as has been emphasised here .
The objectives of establishing political dialogue are to explain the European Union common position on the human rights situation and on the absence of the rule of law and democracy in Burma and to assist in creating conditions that would be conducive to political dialogue between the governing SPDC military junta and the democratic opposition and representatives of the ethnic minorities .
These conditions were met , resulting in the recent lifting of the ban which has had such a major effect on agriculture and related industries in that country .
As far as the Langen report is concerned , and this is really what my intervention is about , as well as sources of renewable energy , everyone knows how important these energies are in reducing pollution and in preserving natural resources .
This is also a question of the expansion of our programme to the associated States . That is what we have the Additional Protocols for .
Mr President , Mr President-in-office of the Council , Commissioner , there is no doubt that the tensions , the insecurity and the instability are all enemies of development and prosperity .
I believe that the Parliament has the task here of clarifying what the concept of Europe , which we can finally also call political Union , should be .
Finally I would like to pledge the Commissioner our full support in the Committee on the Environment for whatever it is that she brings forward .
I know that in that respect Western Europe is doing everything that can be done and this deserves our full support .
I do not know , but anyway motorcycling is enjoying a revival .
There are forces within this Parliament which would quite happily see it scrapped tomorrow but as far as I am concerned my job - and the job of Parliament per se - is to defend the agreement which we made earlier this year .
It has been said here that the priority objective is dealing with inflation , but it is not the only one : we have to think in terms of , amongst other things , an economic focus , responsibility , the international representation of the euro and the monitoring of the banking institutions at a time of significant mergers amongst the financial institutions .
It must not mean new competences for the European Union .
And yet here we have a US Senate , a legislature , which wishes to resist the global environment in which it lives .
Mr President , Commissioner , the extension of the Socrates and Youth programmes is a clear signal sent by the Union to Turkey , to those in Turkey who want Europe and who need Europe .
I would like at this point to stress the vital significance of the fisheries agreements for the EU . They finally constitute and facilitate a guarantee of job security in the EU .
Currency standardisation has resulted in the standardisation of financial policies ; the standardisation of financial policies has resulted in the standardisation of economic policies and the standardisation of economic policies in the standardisation of social policies .
The opinions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities are attached to this second report on today 's agenda .
Mr President , in this plenary sitting we are presenting the Daphne Community action programme on preventive measures to fight violence against children , young people and women .
It is quite clear that if nuclear power and access to nuclear energy are handled in an irresponsible way , this will seriously damage both Europe 's opportunities for growth and its ability to deal successfully with what is , in my view , the most serious threat to the environment , namely climate changes due to increasing carbon dioxide emissions .
The ways and means with which we interact with our partners are not such that I would like to use the term " promote " , particularly concerning something for which there is no acquis .
There is a wide margin between the agricultural guideline and the financial perspectives for the current Member States . This margin could be used for accession in due course .
As an example of concrete action , we have made public the agendas and schedules relating to meetings of both the Council and the working parties .
With the decision that we have now taken , that is to say , to place the Napolitano report on the agenda , there is a problem for the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
But it must also examine very carefully who it is and then it must become clear and unambiguous that it is the UN that is also at stake along with its mandate and its authority and of course the European Union as well .
It would consist of eliminating the APIM gradually until it disappears completely after a few years , perhaps maintaining them partially for a few products .
Allow me to take this opportunity to explain once again the change in strategy towards Turkey , and I certainly do not take what Mr Brie said as a reproach .
I should now like , Madam President , to examine the second proposal by the Commission and , with this in mind , to thank the rapporteur , Mr Gallagher .
As a Dane , I cannot help but comment , in particular , on the Grundtvig initiative .
I am sure that the 21st century will see a humanist and prosperous , powerful and peaceful Europe confirmed among the leaders on the world scene .
Mr President , Mr Wynn asked me three questions , which I briefly answered .
I give the floor to Mr Gollnisch on a point of order .
That right , so recently granted to Parliament post-Amsterdam , is now being snatched away . That has been the cri de coeur of Mr Papayannakis throughout our discussions in the Environment Committee .
We , in all events , should not render ourselves guilty of this arms supply .
